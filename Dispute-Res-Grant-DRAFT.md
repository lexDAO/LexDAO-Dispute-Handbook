### About LexDAO

LexDAO is a (the?) Web3 Legal Engineer's Guild, we're a DAO in a non-profit co-op legal wrapper, summoned to establish standards for legal engineering. We write code, do research, and train legal engineers.

**Here's our mission:**

"LexDAO is a non-profit association of legal engineering professionals that brings the traditional legal settlement layer to code, and coded agreements to the masses. We believe that everyone deserves access to justice provided in a quick and efficient manner. If legal services were easier to use, verify, and enforce, we could live in a fairer world. Blockchain technology offers solutions to many problems in the legal space. Our mission is to research, develop and evangelize first-class legal methods and blockchain protocols that secure rules and promises with code rather than trust. We do this by training LexDAO certified legal engineers and buidling LexDAO certified blockchain applications. We strive to balance new deterministic tools with the equitable considerations of law to better serve our clients, allies, and ultimately citizens."

And if you really want to dig in, here's [our constitution](https://github.com/lexDAO/LexDAO-Constitution/blob/master/LexDAO-Constitution-v01.md). Which we've ratified via on-chain [vote](https://medium.com/lexdaoism/legal-wrappers-and-the-lexdao-constitution-ba89e46a644c).

### The Proposal

In light of recent events within multiple DAO communities simultaneously, we've noticed an increase in the number of incoming questions to LexDAO regarding effective dispute resolution within DAOs and on the blockchain.  

***With this grant we will focus on internal disputes: processes, procedures, and technology to handle disputes between members of a DAO.*** If "rage kick" or any DAO stack's equivalent exists we need to articulate a fair process of communication and escalation to deploy before it happens. (In the law we call this "due process.")

We are seeking grant funding to focus research and writing on this effort. We will adapt existing internal dispute resolution best practices for the DAO context based on research into specific DAO structures and emergent technology. 

### Cross DAO Funding

We consider this a broader DAO eco-system concern, and LexDAO strives to be a cross eco-system organization. Our plan is to seek grant funds from as many DAO ecosystem orgs as possible. We think this will signal commitment to a unified notion of fairness within and across DAO powered communities. We will orchestrate sessions with each, at least, each contributing DAO to asses their existing dispute resolution protocols, and take their input regarding common standards.

### Use of Funds

- Baseline - $5000 would cover LexDAO resources to produce a servicable handbook based on best practices and emergent tech solutions.
- Ideal - $15,000 raised will allow us the bandwidth to expand initial research by incorporating research sessions with a broader range of existing DAOs. This will allow us to flesh out the handbook with greater specificity.
- Stretch - Any amount above $15,000 raised will go toward execution of technological solutions allowing LexDAO to begin to spec out and ultimately build dApps and smart contracts for on-chain mediation and arbitration at the push of a button. This is also the bridge to legal wrappers and externally enforceable dispute resolution.
